# Households Dashboard - Power BI

This repository contains the Power BI dashboard visualizing household-related data. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics and their relationships, offering insights into housing characteristics and population distribution.

## Overview

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

* *Pie Charts:* Illustrate the distribution of Housing_median_age, Total_bedrooms, and Total_rooms, as well as the distribution of Households.
* *Donut Chart:* Shows the distribution of the Sum of population and First ocean_proximity.
* *KPI Cards:* Display the total counts for Households, Population, Bedrooms, and Rooms.
* *Goal Card:* Presents the current value and goal for Latitude and Longitude by population.
* *Stacked Column Chart:* Compares Total_rooms, Total_bedrooms, and Population across different ocean_proximity categories.
* *Line Chart:* Depicts the trend of Households and Housing_median_age by longitude.
* *Area Chart:* Shows the distribution of Median_income by latitude.
* *Map:* Visualizes the geographical distribution of Households by latitude and ocean_proximity.

## Key Insights

This dashboard allows for the exploration of:

* The proportion of different housing age groups and the distribution of bedrooms and rooms.
* The overall counts of households, population, bedrooms, and rooms.
* The relationship between ocean proximity and housing characteristics and population.
* Geographical patterns of households and their proximity to the ocean.
* Trends in housing characteristics and income based on location (latitude and longitude).

## Purpose

This dashboard is designed to provide a clear and intuitive understanding of household demographics and housing attributes. It can be valuable for researchers, urban planners, real estate professionals, and anyone interested in analyzing housing and population data.

## How to Use

This repository primarily contains an image of the Power BI dashboard. To interact with the live dashboard, you would need the original .pbix file, which is not included in this repository. However, the image provides a static view of the key insights derived from the data.

## Potential Further Development

* Including interactive filters and slicers for more granular analysis.
* Adding more detailed breakdowns of housing characteristics.
* Integrating additional datasets for a more comprehensive view.
* Developing drill-through capabilities for deeper exploration of specific regions or categories.
